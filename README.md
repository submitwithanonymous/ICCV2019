### Introduction

This is the source code and additional visualization examples of our Radial-GCN, Radial Graph Convolutional Network for Visual Question Generation.

1) Different from the existing approaches that typically treat the VQG task as a reversed VQA task, we propose a novel answer-centric approach for the VQG task, which effectively models the associations between the answer and its relevant image regions.
2)  To our best knowledge, we are the first to apply GCN model for the VQG task and devise a new radial graph structure with graphic attention for superior question generation performance and interpretable model behavior. 
3)  We conduct comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets to verify the advantage of our proposed method on generating meaningful questions on the VQG task and boosting the existing VQA methods on the challenging zero-shot VQA task.
